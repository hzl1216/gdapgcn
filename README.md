## Requirements

## Usage
our project structure is 

[PROJECT_NAME] /

        files/

             results/ 

             networks/

             data_files

        code/
    
To run this model on the task, one only need to run **python main.py** with some args parameters, you also can run some run some programs 
separately,such as **python graph.py** to generate the word2vec model and some files for train and test.
